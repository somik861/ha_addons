# My own Home Assistant addon repository

## Note that this repository is for my personal use. 

You can do anything with the code, use it and modify it as you want, but the local addresses, user account credentials, etc. are for my setup and you need to modify (fork the repository and modify it on your side) the code to work with your home assistant.

# THE CODE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS' WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY
